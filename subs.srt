<i>with a Google alert on you.</i>

166
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:46,562
<i>[April] I hate the Internet.</i>

167
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:47,812
<i>[whistle blares]</i>

168
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:50,729
<i>[coach] All right, boys, let's go,</i>
<i>come on. Pick up your feet.</i>

169
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:51,812
<i>-Go Churners.</i>
<i>-Great!</i>

170
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:53,646
<i>This rate, we'll be</i>
<i>the slowest football team.</i>

171
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:56,437
<i>-RJ, pick up the pace.</i>
<i>-I'm trying my best, coach.</i>

172
00:08:58,187 --> 00:08:59,646
<i>You too, Goldilocks, come on.</i>

173
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:02,396
<i>-See the team still sucks.</i>
<i>-[coach] ...get home next week.</i>

174
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:04,062
<i>-Buzz.</i>
<i>-Pick up your feet! Hey, Frank.</i>

175
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:04,979
<i>How you doing?</i>

176
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:07,729
<i>You call that a run? Let's go.</i>

177
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:15,521
<i>Has anyone moved into your old store?</i>

178
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:17,687
<i>No.</i>

179
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:21,271
<i>Stupid pharmacy chain,</i>
<i>putting us little guys out of business.</i>

180
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:22,854
<i>At least they gave you a job.</i>

181
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,354
<i>Yeah, part-time but...</i>

182
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,021
<i>I really blew it, Dad.</i>

183
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:31,646
<i>Such a failure.</i>

184
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:32,854
<i>[Frank] Oh, honey.</i>

185
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:35,354
<i>You know what will make you feel better?</i>

186
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:36,687
<i>Cheese.</i>

187
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,354
<i>[woman] Thank you, Karen. </i>
<i>Say hi to your mom.</i>

188
00:09:41,604 --> 00:09:44,562
<i>-Mmm--</i>
<i>-April! Oh!</i>

189
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:46,604
<i>[laughs]</i>

190
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,229
<i>-Miss Barb.</i>
<i>-[Barb] Oh, my gosh!</i>

191
00:09:49,312 --> 00:09:51,854
<i>Well, I was just getting snacks</i>
<i>for the pep rally. Go Churners!</i>

192
00:09:51,937 --> 00:09:53,396
<i>-Go Churners!</i>
<i>-And I thought,</i>

193
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,062
<i>"Is that April?"</i>

194
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:57,354
<i>But then I go,</i>
<i>"Well, that can't be April</i>

195
00:09:57,437 --> 00:10:00,646
<i>because April is in NYC." And yet, </i>

196
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:02,396
<i>here you are! Oh, my God!</i>

197
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,229
<i>Oh! I just saw Nick.</i>

198
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,396
<i>Well, how funny is that?</i>

199
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:07,562
<i>Nick's here?</i>

200
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:08,812
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

201
00:10:08,896 --> 00:10:11,687
<i>It's just like old times.</i>
<i>I mean, you know,</i>

202
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:13,354
<i>minus you two being joined at the lips...</i>

203
00:10:13,437 --> 00:10:15,854
<i>[whispers] ...and before you broke up</i>
<i>in that text message. </i>

204
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:18,479
<i>I cannot believe you are standing</i>
<i>right in front of me.</i>

205
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:19,396
<i>Oh!</i>

206
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:22,729
<i>You remember my little one,</i>

207
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:23,979
<i>June?</i>

208
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:27,729
<i>Yeah, she was in Pampers</i>
<i>the last time that you saw her. Junie.</i>

209
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:29,396
<i>This is who I've been talking about.</i>

210
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,729
<i>Yeah, the high school's all-time</i>
<i>greatest cheerleader. Go Churners!</i>

211
00:10:33,812 --> 00:10:34,854
<i>[all] Go Churners!</i>

212
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:37,396
<i>And Mommy's biggest success story.</i>

213
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,896
<i>She is a Broadway star!</i>

214
00:10:40,604 --> 00:10:42,271
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

215
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,396
<i>Oh, my gosh,</i>
<i>you have to come by the studio</i>

216
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,937
<i>and say hi to the girls! </i>

217
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:49,187
<i>I would love to.</i>

218
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:50,229
<i>Great!</i>

219
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:51,937
<i>But my dad's been sick.</i>

220
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:54,229
<i>-Who's sick?</i>
<i>-Oh, no. Frank, are you sick?</i>

221
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:55,521
<i>-Yeah...</i>
<i>-Oh, my God.</i>

222
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:57,062
<i>Well, I'll make you a casserole.</i>

223
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:59,396
<i>That's what I'm gonna do. Okay.</i>

224
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:03,937
<i>Well, it was just so, </i>
<i>so wonderful to... see you, and I just--</i>

225
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:07,437
<i>The girls will just-- They'll be</i>
<i>so disappointed not to meet you, but--</i>

226
00:11:07,521 --> 00:11:09,104
<i>I know, it's such a shame.</i>

227
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:12,562
<i>Let's not disappoint the girls.</i>
<i>She'll be happy to meet them.</i>

228
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:16,729
<i>[Barb] Really? Oh, well that's fantastic!</i>

229
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:20,021
<i>[chuckles] Oh, my G-- Okay, well,</i>
<i>you know where the studio is.</i>

230
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:23,146
<i>I'll see you at 5:30.</i>

231
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:24,521
<i>Take care of yourself, Frank.</i>

232
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:25,646
<i>Super.</i>

233
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,229
<i>Would it have killed you to play sick?</i>

234
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:38,146
<i>[gasps] Whoopsie-daisy. Go Churners!</i>

235
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:39,771
<i>[all] Go Churners!</i>

236
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:49,896
<i>[woman] Come on, ladies.</i>

237
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:52,437
<i>[Nick] All right. Here we are.</i>

238
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,604
<i>Make sure you have everything.</i>

239
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:55,604
<i>Bye!</i>

240
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:57,146
<i>[Nick] Have a good class.</i>

241
00:11:58,646 --> 00:12:01,562
<i>Hey, Sarah. Don't forget</i>
<i>to help Michelle with her shoes, okay?</i>

242
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:03,687
<i>You don't have to tell me, Nick.</i>

243
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:06,104
<i>See you, guys.</i>

244
00:12:06,562 --> 00:12:08,854
<i>Whoo! I bet you don't miss those stairs, </i>
<i>huh?</i>

245
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,187
<i>Oh! Look, we put your picture on the wall.</i>

246
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:13,854
<i>Honey, don't worry about that right now.</i>

247
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:15,937
<i>The little genius balances my books.</i>

248
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:18,062
<i>But I owe you this shift</i>
<i>for my classes this week.</i>

249
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:20,187
<i>[Barb] The receipts can wait.</i>

250
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:21,937
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>help me get all the girls together.</i>

251
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:24,396
<i>We have a special guest tonight.</i>
<i>You know what? </i>

252
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:27,229
<i>Actually, will you please</i>
<i>get a chair for Miss April?</i>

253
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:28,937
<i>-Yes. On it.</i>
<i>-[Barb] Mm-hmm.</i>

254
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:31,104
<i>[Barb chuckles]</i>

255
00:12:31,604 --> 00:12:34,854
<i>I know I only taught you for eight years,</i>
<i>three months and 22 days</i>

256
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:37,896
<i>before you ended up</i>
<i>studying in Milwaukee for real.</i>

257
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:39,854
<i>But, you know,</i>

258
00:12:39,937 --> 00:12:42,687
<i>I kind of like to think </i>
<i>I still had something to do with you</i>

259
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:45,771
<i>becoming a Broadway sensation.</i>

260
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:46,896
<i>[chuckles]</i>

261
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:49,646
<i>Ooh! Speaking of which,</i>
<i>let me plant a seed.</i>

262
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:52,979
<i>While you're home visiting,</i>
<i>maybe you could teach a master class?</i>

263
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:54,937
<i>Or three?</i>

264
00:12:55,104 --> 00:12:56,437
<i>Yeah, let me get back to you--</i>

265
00:12:56,562 --> 00:13:00,771
<i>Because I was thinking,</i>
<i>for next year, maybe,</i>

266
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:02,479
<i>doing one of these.</i>

267
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:05,229
<i>-A dance competition.</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

268
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,771
<i>-Wow!</i>
<i>-Yeah!</i>

269
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,187
<i>Oh, and you know, this one</i>

270
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:12,146
<i>has a special category </i>
<i>called the "Teacher Feature,"</i>

271
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:13,312
<i>where the teacher,</i>

272
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:16,521
<i>gets to perform with her students!</i>
<i>Isn't that adorable?</i>

273
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:19,646
<i>I mean, of course,</i>
<i>this year's first round is this weekend,</i>

274
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:21,937
<i>and even though we've been working </i>
<i>on a few routines,</i>

275
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:24,979
<i>we are nowhere near this level</i>
<i>or even remotely ready.</i>

276
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:27,479
<i>My dad is in the truck and--</i>

277
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:29,354
<i>Oh, my gosh, Frank!</i>

278
00:13:30,354 --> 00:13:31,354
<i>I completely forgot.</i>

279
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:33,229
<i>-I gotta make him a casserole.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

280
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,062
<i>-We've to get him to bed, don't we?</i>
<i>-We do.</i>

281
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:36,062
<i>Okay. So, </i>

282
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:39,562
<i>here we go. Well, just a little quick...</i>

283
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:42,729
<i>-[boy imitating car engine]</i>
<i>-[Sarah] Michelle, sit still.</i>

284
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:44,562
<i>Sarah?</i>

285
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:48,604
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

286
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,604
<i>You look so much...</i>

287
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:53,271
<i>older.</i>

288
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:56,062
<i>[scoffs]</i>

289
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:01,354
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

290
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:03,521
<i>I want you to welcome</i>

291
00:14:03,604 --> 00:14:07,354
<i>a very special guest,</i>
<i>straight from Broadway,</i>

292
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:10,104
<i>Miss April!</i>

293
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:12,229
<i>[cheering]</i>

294
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,146
<i>[boy imitating car engine]</i>

295
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:18,729
<i>Right. You remember coach Buzz.</i>

296
00:14:18,812 --> 00:14:22,229
<i>He leaves his son here</i>
<i>while he's at practice. Dicky!</i>

297
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:24,521
<i>Honey. Sh! Sh!</i>

298
00:14:25,062 --> 00:14:26,854
<i>Just while his sister's in class.</i>

299
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:29,979
<i>All right. Questions, anyone?</i>

300
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:30,896
<i>Okay.</i>

301
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:33,854
<i>-Ruby.</i>
<i>-First off, I made this,</i>

302
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:35,604
<i>and I want you to have it.</i>

303
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,312
<i>Second off, I want you to wear it.</i>

304
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:47,979
<i>[Barb] Well, thank you, Ruby. </i>
<i>-[Ruby] Mm-hmm.</i>

305
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:50,937
<i>[Barb] Oh, my goodness, </i>
<i>that's just beautiful.</i>

306
00:14:51,646 --> 00:14:52,854
<i>Uh, Zuzu.</i>

307
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:56,354
<i>How old were you when you started dancing?</i>

308
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,479
<i>-She's deaf?</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>

309
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:00,604
<i>How does she dance on the beat?</i>

310
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:05,854
<i>I feel the vibrations.</i>

311
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:06,854
<i>Um...</i>

312
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:08,229
<i>Kari.</i>

313
00:15:08,312 --> 00:15:10,437
<i>How did you get to dance on Broadway?</i>

314
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:12,146
<i>Hard work. Next.</i>

315
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:15,521
<i>-[Barb] Oona.</i>
<i>-When they pick people for parts in shows</i>

316
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:18,062
<i>does the most talented dancer</i>
<i>always get the part?</i>

317
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:19,854
<i>Nope. Next.</i>

318
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:20,854
<i>Lucia.</i>

319
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:24,812
<i>-What was I gonna say?</i>
<i>-Next.</i>

320
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:27,312
<i>-[Barb] Michelle.</i>
<i>-How come you're not in any show now?</i>

321
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:28,771
<i>As a matter of fact, um...</i>

322
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:33,771
<i>I just got a part...</i>

323
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:36,229
<i>-[Barb gasps]</i>
<i>-...in this huge Ruth Zimmer show.</i>

324
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:37,354
<i>[Oona] Who's Ruth Zimmer?</i>

325
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,021
<i>-What do you play?</i>
<i>-What's the show about?</i>

326
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,604
<i>-[Kari] Can we see a dance from it?</i>
<i>-I wanna be on Broadway.</i>

650
00:31:18,187 --> 00:31:20,354
<i>Just do exactly what I say</i>
<i>and we'll advance.</i>

651
00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:21,271
<i>Got it?</i>

652
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:24,937
<i>Now, before we begin,</i>
<i>there are three basic ground rules.</i>

653
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:26,896
<i>Rule number one: Focus!</i>

654
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:29,729
<i>Clearly no one's ever taught you how.</i>
<i>No offense, Miss Barb.</i>

655
00:31:29,812 --> 00:31:31,146
<i>[chuckles] None taken.</i>

656
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:34,771
<i>So, from now on, </i>
<i>anyone who speaks without permission,</i>

657
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:38,271
<i>-drops and gives me 20 push-ups.</i>
<i>-[all laughing] Yeah, okay.</i>

658
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,979
<i>[false laugh]</i>

659
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:41,187
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

660
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:43,437
<i>Number two:</i>

661
00:31:43,896 --> 00:31:44,937
<i>Commitment.</i>

662
00:31:45,021 --> 00:31:47,521
<i>A dancer without technique is nothing.</i>

663
00:31:47,604 --> 00:31:48,521
<i>So, right now,</i>

664
00:31:49,312 --> 00:31:50,396
<i>you are nothing.</i>

665
00:31:53,896 --> 00:31:54,979
<i>Number three:</i>

666
00:31:55,604 --> 00:31:56,437
<i>Do...</i>

667
00:31:56,729 --> 00:31:57,562
<i>exactly...</i>

668
00:31:58,187 --> 00:31:59,021
<i>what...</i>

669
00:31:59,312 --> 00:32:00,146
<i>I...</i>

670
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:01,354
<i>say.</i>

671
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,021
<i>Got it?</i>

672
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:06,229
<i>-Got it?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

673
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:08,312
<i>-Yes, Miss April.</i>
<i>-Yes, Miss April.</i>

674
00:32:09,104 --> 00:32:10,562
<i>Everyone, take a spot at the barre.</i>

675
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:11,729
<i>Yes, Miss April.</i>

676
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:18,229
<i>Mommy. I already forgot what rule one is.</i>

677
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,146
<i>No talking!</i>

678
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,521
<i>-Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>-Drop and give me 20 push-ups. Now.</i>

679
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:23,812
<i>Yes, Miss April.</i>

680
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:26,729
<i>[whispers] One.</i>

681
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:28,896
<i>-Two. Three.</i>
<i>-[April] We have two weeks till Counties.</i>

682
00:32:29,521 --> 00:32:31,604
<i>-Four.</i>
<i>-[April] Two weeks. Two.</i>

683
00:32:32,187 --> 00:32:34,437
<i>Not a lot of time</i>
<i>to whip you guys into shape.</i>

684
00:32:34,937 --> 00:32:35,771
<i>So,</i>

685
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:37,521
<i>from now on...</i>

686
00:32:38,896 --> 00:32:41,312
<i>unless you're asleep, or at school...</i>

687
00:32:42,729 --> 00:32:43,854
<i>you will be here.</i>

688
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:45,687
<i>Practicing,</i>

689
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:48,062
<i>day in and day out.</i>

690
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:48,979
<i>[June] Seventeen.</i>

691
00:32:49,562 --> 00:32:51,021
<i>[April] Left hand on the barre.</i>

692
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:53,021
<i>-[June] Twenty.</i>
<i>-Miss Barb, count 'em in.</i>

693
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,271
<i>[Barb] And side, again the front.</i>

694
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:58,979
<i>And side and back, the side to the front.</i>

695
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,562
<i>-Keep going. Side.</i>
<i>-Timing.</i>

696
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,229
<i>[April] Do it again.</i>

697
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:03,437
<i>[pants]</i>

698
00:33:03,687 --> 00:33:05,104
<i>Maybe we should take a little break.</i>

699
00:33:05,187 --> 00:33:07,021
<i>-They get five minutes at 9:00 p.m.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

700
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:09,104
<i>Feel the beat.</i>

701
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,979
<i>There's no syncopation here.</i>

702
00:33:11,062 --> 00:33:12,812
<i>Then where can the sink go on vacation?</i>

703
00:33:12,896 --> 00:33:14,354
<i>You. Push-ups.</i>

704
00:33:14,854 --> 00:33:15,687
<i>Now.</i>

705
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:17,562
<i>[sighs]</i>

706
00:33:17,646 --> 00:33:19,354
<i>[June] Yes, Miss April.</i>

707
00:33:19,437 --> 00:33:21,729
<i>Let's take it from the </i>glissade piqué.
<i>From the top.</i>

708
00:33:22,271 --> 00:33:23,104
<i>Today.</i>

709
00:33:23,396 --> 00:33:25,562
<i>[Barb] Okay, hustle. Everybody ready?</i>

710
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:27,354
<i>One, two, three, four,</i>

711
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:29,104
<i>five, six, over!</i>

712
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:30,396
<i>-And--</i>
<i>-[Oona] My glasses!</i>

713
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:31,354
<i>[April] Stop!</i>

714
00:33:31,437 --> 00:33:32,521
<i>[Lucia] Sorry, Ruby!</i>

715
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:36,062
<i>Eyeballs. Do I have</i>
<i>to duct tape those to your face?</i>

716
00:33:36,896 --> 00:33:37,771
<i>Fingers.</i>

717
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:39,979
<i>I thought you could feel the beat.</i>

718
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:42,021
<i>So why are you always behind?</i>

719
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:45,812
<i>And...</i>

720
00:33:45,896 --> 00:33:46,896
<i>-Pigtails.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

721
00:33:47,604 --> 00:33:49,854
<i>You literally have no idea</i>
<i>what you're doing.</i>

722
00:33:50,646 --> 00:33:52,437
<i>Don't waste my time</i>
<i>and go learn the steps.</i>

723
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,729
<i>Go!</i>

724
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:57,396
<i>The rest of you, up on your highest</i>
<i>demi-pointe. Close your ribs. Again.</i>

725
00:33:57,854 --> 00:33:58,729
<i>[whispers] Again?</i>

726
00:33:58,854 --> 00:33:59,687
<i>[April] Today.</i>

727
00:34:01,396 --> 00:34:02,687
<i>Okay. Everybody ready?</i>

728
00:34:03,312 --> 00:34:04,146
<i>Ready?</i>

729
00:34:04,396 --> 00:34:07,229
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six, over!</i>

730
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:08,687
<i>-And up!</i>
<i>-Stop!</i>

731
00:34:08,771 --> 00:34:10,479
<i>Oh, okay. Stop.</i>

732
00:34:11,021 --> 00:34:12,146
<i>Is everyone ready?</i>

733
00:34:12,604 --> 00:34:13,437
<i>We're ready.</i>

734
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:14,896
<i>In positions.</i>

735
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:18,479
<i>That's two straight lines.</i>

736
00:34:18,562 --> 00:34:20,479
<i>Okay. Everybody hustle. Ready?</i>

737
00:34:20,562 --> 00:34:23,437
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six, over!</i>

738
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,521
<i>And up!</i>

739
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,437
<i>-On your leg.</i>
<i>-Over. And up!</i>

740
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:28,646
<i>-[April] On your leg. Get on your leg!</i>
<i>-Over. And--</i>

741
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:30,687
<i>[April] Do you hear me yelling at you?</i>

742
00:34:32,354 --> 00:34:33,479
<i>Then do it!</i>

743
00:34:34,062 --> 00:34:35,229
<i>What is the problem?</i>

744
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:38,187
<i>Maybe it's that we have</i>
<i>no idea what you're yelling.</i>

745
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:40,104
<i>If we weren't on our legs,</i>
<i>we'd be on our butts!</i>

746
00:34:40,187 --> 00:34:41,312
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

747
00:34:41,854 --> 00:34:44,062
<i>All right. Why don't you just</i>

748
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:45,854
<i>-take a moment to explain--</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

749
00:34:46,021 --> 00:34:48,479
<i>How about you try teaching?</i>
<i>Instead of leaving us clueless,</i>

750
00:34:48,562 --> 00:34:50,687
<i>standing here with our wieners</i>
<i>swinging in the breeze.</i>

751
00:34:52,562 --> 00:34:53,979
<i>You think you can do better?</i>

752
00:34:54,854 --> 00:34:57,437
<i>Well, you're such a crappy teacher,</i>
<i>I certainly can't do worse.</i>

753
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:00,729
<i>Get out of my class.</i>

754
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:04,521
<i>Make me.</i>

755
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,479
<i>Get out...</i>

756
00:35:07,562 --> 00:35:08,479
<i>of my...</i>

757
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:10,062
<i>class.</i>

758
00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:12,687
<i>You get out of my face!</i>

759
00:35:15,437 --> 00:35:16,354
<i>I'm done.</i>

760
00:35:17,229 --> 00:35:18,354
<i>[huffs]</i>

761
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:19,812
<i>Good luck, Miss Barb.</i>

762
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:22,146
<i>-They're hopeless.</i>
<i>-I knew you wouldn't stick around.</i>

763
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:29,521
<i>You got something else to say?</i>

764
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:31,646
<i>-Don't be shy, Nail-biter.</i>
<i>-[retches]</i>

765
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:33,229
<i>-[Kari retches]</i>
<i>-[Barb] Kari...</i>

<i>[coughing]</i>

767

<i>Where's my crayon?</i>

768
00:35:39,896 --> 00:35:41,437
<i>[cell phone rings]</i>

769
00:35:41,604 --> 00:35:43,437
<i>Woman, you better be calling to apologize.</i>

770
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:44,354
<i>For what?</i>

771
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:46,771
<i>Oh, it's you. I'm sorry. </i>
<i>I thought you were Mar Jar.</i>

772
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,437
<i>-Who?</i>
-Marissa Jaret Winokur.

773
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,771
<i>Oh, I danced in a benefit</i>
<i>she did for Broadway Cares.</i>

774
00:35:50,854 --> 00:35:53,562
<i>Well, I loaned that thief</i>
<i>these vintage Louboutins</i>

775
00:35:53,646 --> 00:35:56,187
<i>for this Tony Award</i>
<i>Winners Luncheon, and now she</i>

776
00:35:56,271 --> 00:35:57,771
<i>claims she gave 'em back.</i>

777
00:35:57,854 --> 00:36:00,021
<i>But why are you calling me? </i>
<i>I thought you got banished</i>

778
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:02,021
<i>to, uh... Idaho?</i>

779
00:36:02,104 --> 00:36:03,104
<i>Wisconsin.</i>

780
00:36:03,187 --> 00:36:05,312
<i>-Oh!</i>
 -Long story short,

781
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,437
<i>this amazing opportunity presented itself </i>

782
00:36:07,521 --> 00:36:10,771
<i>to dance in front of Welly Wong. And...</i>

783
00:36:11,396 --> 00:36:13,396
<i>-</i>[Ruby sobbing]<i> </i>That's it. I quit.
-Hold on.

784
00:36:14,604 --> 00:36:15,437
<i>I'm quitting.</i>

<i>[sobs]</i>

<i>[sobs]</i>

<i>Am I really that bad?</i>

788
00:36:23,687 --> 00:36:25,062
<i>Uh...</i>

789
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:28,021
<i>Yeah.</i>

790
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:29,854
<i>Oh.</i>

791
00:36:32,062 --> 00:36:34,187
<i>I just wanna be good at something.</i>

792

<i>[sobs]</i>

00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:39,354
<i>-[Ruby] I'll find something else to do.</i>
<i>-I'm just gonna...</i>

794
00:36:41,146 --> 00:36:44,187
<i>-close this anyway.</i>
<i>-[Ruby sobbing] Thank you, Miss April.</i>

795
00:36:45,354 --> 00:36:46,229
<i>You still there?</i>

796
00:36:46,312 --> 00:36:50,979
<i>Your maternal instincts</i>
<i>are beyond aspirational.</i>

00:36:51,187 --> 00:36:52,146
<i>[chuckles]</i>

<i>[groans]</i>

00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:55,896
<i>[Barb] Okay.</i>

800
00:36:56,312 --> 00:36:59,021
<i>Being "on your leg" is kind of like</i>

801
00:36:59,104 --> 00:37:02,396
<i>the difference between</i>
<i>a banana and a carrot.</i>

802
00:37:02,812 --> 00:37:04,604
<i>See? Crooked things</i>

803
00:37:05,104 --> 00:37:08,271
<i>can't balance. Aw.</i>

804
00:37:08,354 --> 00:37:09,187
<i>But...</i>

805
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,229
<i>straight things...</i>

806
00:37:12,312 --> 00:37:14,562
<i>-[inhales] Aw!</i>
<i>-Aw!</i>

807
00:37:14,729 --> 00:37:16,729
<i>Wait. Why didn't she just say that?</i>

808
00:37:16,812 --> 00:37:18,104
<i>Oh, you know.</i>

809
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:20,062
<i>Miss April's kinda funny.</i>

810
00:37:20,812 --> 00:37:23,271
<i>You know, she always wants to be perfect,</i>

811
00:37:23,562 --> 00:37:27,396
<i>and, you know, she was about your age</i>

812
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:32,354
<i>when she decided that she needed</i>
<i>to become an amazing dancer.</i>

813
00:37:32,437 --> 00:37:37,271
<i>So, she started pushing herself</i>
<i>harder, harder, and...</i>

814
00:37:37,729 --> 00:37:43,604
<i>she forgets that other people</i>
<i>aren't as perfect as she is.</i>

815
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:44,979
<i>So, we...</i>

816
00:37:46,229 --> 00:37:48,604
<i>gotta be real patient with her.</i>

817
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:50,979
<i>-Okay?</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:52,271
<i>Can I tell you a secret?</i>

819
00:37:53,937 --> 00:37:56,104
<i>[whispers] Sometimes I feel like a banana.</i>

820
00:37:56,979 --> 00:37:57,854
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

821
00:37:58,312 --> 00:38:00,521
<i>What about you?</i>
<i>Are you a banana or a carrot?</i>

822
00:38:00,604 --> 00:38:02,271
<i>-A carrot.</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

823
00:38:02,604 --> 00:38:04,104
<i>I'm so proud of you. Good job.</i>

<i>-[April] You don't have to stop.</i>
<i>-I have to get home anyway.</i>

831
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,062
<i>If you connect to your center and...</i>

832
00:39:19,521 --> 00:39:22,062
<i>you really hold your core,</i>
<i>you'll have more control over your body.</i>

833
00:39:23,146 --> 00:39:24,229
<i>Super, thanks.</i>

834
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:28,646
<i>And if there's ever anything</i>
<i>that you wanna talk about that you...</i>

835
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:31,646
<i>maybe can't talk to Nick</i>
<i>or your grandma about it.</i>

836
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:34,104
<i>-I've been there, done that, so--</i>
<i>-All set. Can I go now?</i>

837
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:38,187
<i>Look, Sarah, </i>
<i>I'm just trying to meet you halfway.</i>

838
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:41,771
<i>We’re not in class, so I don’t</i>
<i>have to listen to anything you say.</i>

839
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:44,771
<i>What is your problem?</i>

840
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:47,729
<i>What happened to you? </i>
<i>You weren't like this before.</i>

841
00:39:47,812 --> 00:39:48,646
<i>Before what?</i>

842
00:39:49,062 --> 00:39:50,604
<i>Before you left or before my mom died?</i>

843
00:39:51,437 --> 00:39:52,896
<i>No, don't use that as a crutch.</i>

844
00:39:53,354 --> 00:39:55,396
<i>-I had to grow up without a mom too.</i>
<i>-Did she die?</i>

845
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:56,396
<i>No.</i>

846
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:58,229
<i>No. My mom left me by choice.</i>

847
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,229
<i>You wanna unpack that one?</i>

848
00:40:00,312 --> 00:40:01,979
<i>Well, like mother, like daughter, I guess.</i>

849
00:40:03,771 --> 00:40:04,604
<i>Excuse me?</i>

850
00:40:05,396 --> 00:40:07,187
<i>You left without even saying goodbye.</i>

851
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:10,146
<i>Sarah, people live their own lives.</i>

852
00:40:11,146 --> 00:40:12,271
<i>Get used to it.</i>

853
00:40:13,396 --> 00:40:15,646
<i>Besides, it's not like I was dating you.</i>

854
00:40:16,312 --> 00:40:18,729
<i>Right. Then I’d at least have gotten </i>
<i>a text message.</i>

855
00:40:18,812 --> 00:40:20,812
<i>But who cares </i>
<i>about the dumb little sister anyway?</i>

856
00:40:29,312 --> 00:40:32,146
<i>There's got to have been a thousand people</i>
<i>that auditioned before me.</i>

857
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,062
<i>I've been waiting to audition</i>
<i>for the new Welly Wong show "Whirly Girl,"</i>

858
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:36,812
<i>and I'm almost at the front.</i>

859
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,104
<i>I hope I get a callback.</i>

<i>[Nick] Hey!</i>

863
00:40:58,312 --> 00:41:00,979
<i>-What are you doing down there?</i>
<i>-Looking for my phone.</i>

864
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:02,521
<i>It's in your hand.</i>

865
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:08,021
<i>Yes, that's 'cause I already found it.</i>
<i>Obviously.</i>

866
00:41:11,312 --> 00:41:13,937
<i>[April] Um, so what are you doing here?</i>

867
00:41:14,062 --> 00:41:15,521
<i>Oh, you know, not much.</i>

868
00:41:15,687 --> 00:41:18,604
<i>I was just working down the street</i>
<i>when I saw Grandma drive by in my truck.</i>

869
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:19,729
<i>Hey, Grams!</i>

870
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:22,562
<i>[yells] Oh, Nicky!</i>

871
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,562
<i>Technically, she's not allowed </i>
<i>to drive anymore</i>

872
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:26,729
<i>but she loves this merry-go-round.</i>

873
00:41:28,354 --> 00:41:29,187
<i>So...</i>

874
00:41:29,604 --> 00:41:32,271
<i>Sarah told me you guys</i>
<i>had a fun class last night.</i>

875
00:41:32,896 --> 00:41:35,854
<i>Oh, yeah. It was a barrel of laughs.</i>

876
00:41:36,187 --> 00:41:38,854
<i>I mean, I’m trying to help her,</i>
<i>but it’s like a brick wall.</i>

877
00:41:38,937 --> 00:41:40,146
<i>That doesn't sound right.</i>

878
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:43,312
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-Yeah, you trying to help someone?</i>

879
00:41:43,812 --> 00:41:46,146
<i>Ha ha. Very funny.</i>

880
00:41:47,979 --> 00:41:51,229
<i>Hey, look, she's not gonna put out</i>
<i>the welcome mat just 'cause you're back.</i>

881
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:54,479
<i>You know, you're the reason </i>
<i>she started dancing.</i>

882
00:41:54,562 --> 00:41:56,229
<i>You were her lifeline and then...</i>

883
00:41:56,646 --> 00:41:57,771
<i>poof.</i>

884
00:41:58,479 --> 00:42:00,187
<i>You know, if you really wanna help her,</i>

885
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:04,062
<i>try remembering what it was like</i>
<i>when you were in her shoes.</i>

886
00:42:05,562 --> 00:42:06,396
<i>You know,</i>

887
00:42:06,979 --> 00:42:08,812
<i>when you were all moody </i>
<i>and wearing flannel.</i>

888
00:42:09,979 --> 00:42:11,729
<i>-That never happened.</i>
<i>-Pictures don't lie.</i>

889
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:13,937
<i>No, I have no recollection.</i>

890
00:42:14,021 --> 00:42:15,146
<i>-[laughs] Oh, okay.</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>

891
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:27,187
<i>Rehearsals can get intense.</i>

892
00:42:28,062 --> 00:42:29,187
<i>It's part of the job.</i>

893
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:31,062
<i>[Sarah] Duh, that's why Ruby quit.</i>

894
00:42:34,896 --> 00:42:35,979
<i>Moving on.</i>

895
00:42:37,229 --> 00:42:39,979
<i>Dude, you walked out after one class.</i>

896
00:42:40,062 --> 00:42:41,062
<i>We're just kids.</i>

897
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:43,854
<i>We don't learn </i>
<i>as fast as you professionals.</i>

898
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:45,437
<i>And what about rule number two?</i>

899
00:42:46,104 --> 00:42:47,021
<i>Commitment?</i>

900
00:42:47,104 --> 00:42:48,604
<i>[sighs] Point taken.</i>

901
00:42:48,979 --> 00:42:50,937
<i>If you promise to do what I tell you.</i>

902
00:42:51,354 --> 00:42:52,604
<i>and curtail the attitude,</i>

903
00:42:53,229 --> 00:42:54,979
<i>I promise to honor my commitment...</i>

904
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:57,729
<i>and see it through to the end.</i>

905
00:42:59,896 --> 00:43:00,854
<i>Deal?</i>

906
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:09,646
<i>Well, what do you guys want to do?</i>

907
00:43:09,937 --> 00:43:10,771
<i>I mean...</i>

908
00:43:11,604 --> 00:43:13,104
<i>I want to keep competing.</i>

909
00:43:13,562 --> 00:43:14,646
<i>-Me too.</i>
<i>-Me too.</i>

910
00:43:15,187 --> 00:43:17,604
<i>[sighs] But I don't want to do it </i>
<i>with her. </i>

911
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:19,479
<i>-Me too.</i>
<i>-Me too.</i>

912
00:43:19,687 --> 00:43:20,771
<i>Well, yeah...</i>

913
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:23,771
<i>but she's the only one good enough</i>
<i>to get us there.</i>

914
00:43:31,937 --> 00:43:33,312
<i>So, do we have a deal?</i>

915
00:43:35,271 --> 00:43:36,104
<i>Deal.</i>

916
00:43:37,854 --> 00:43:38,687
<i>Okay.</i>

917
00:43:40,271 --> 00:43:41,479
<i>Let's start with the barre,</i>

918
00:43:41,562 --> 00:43:43,646
<i>because we've got a lot to do </i>
<i>in two weeks.</i>

<i>First position.</i>

920

<i>Fifth position.</i>

<i>There it is.</i>
<i>That’s a nice </i>port de bras. <i>See that?</i>

00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,187
<i>[June] I can't see anything.</i>

923
00:43:53,729 --> 00:43:54,729
<i>Twenty.</i>

<i>wave goodbye to Nationals. </i>
<i>Wave goodbye. Bye.</i>
